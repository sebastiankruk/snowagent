## [0.9.5] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Table Health plugin** (disabled by default): monitors table storage metrics (active bytes, time-travel bytes, failsafe bytes, row count), clustering depth, and period-over-period growth for FinOps storage analysis. Runs every 6 hours.
- **Cold tables identification plugin** (disabled by default): identifies tables with no recent query access (default: >90 days) to find candidates for archiving or dropping. Runs daily. See [Cold Tables plugin](PLUGINS.md#cold_tables_info_sec).
- **Org costs plugin** (disabled by default): reports organization-level Snowflake cost metrics from `SNOWFLAKE.ORGANIZATION_USAGE` — credits, storage, data transfer, billing amounts, and remaining contract balances. Requires ORGADMIN. See [Org Costs plugin](PLUGINS.md#org_costs_info_sec).
- **Metering plugin**: reports credit consumption across all Snowflake service types via `METERING_HISTORY` with `snowflake.service.type` dimension for FinOps cost attribution.
- **Signal protection** for `query_history` plugin: configurable `max_entries` top-N limiting, include/exclude filters for warehouses/databases/users, and `max_lookback_minutes` watermark window. Prevents overload on high-volume Snowflake accounts. Self-monitoring bizevents emitted when active.
- **Query text obfuscation** for `query_history` plugin: new `obfuscation_mode` config key (`off` / `literals` / `full`). Mode `literals` replaces string and numeric literals with `?`; mode `full` replaces the entire query and error text with `[OBFUSCATED]`. Default `off`.
- **Warehouse change attribution** for `query_history` plugin (experimental): `track_ddl_changes` config key surfaces DDL change details (`snowflake.object.{type,name,ddl.operation,ddl.properties}`) on query spans using `ACCESS_HISTORY.OBJECT_MODIFIED_BY_DDL`. Ships with the new *Warehouse Change Detection* dashboard and `warehouse-sensitive-change-alert` workflow.
- **Cross-batch span parent linking** for `query_history` plugin: OTEL span context persisted in `PROCESSED_QUERIES_CACHE` links child queries to parents across agent run cycles. Cache TTL configurable via `query_history.cache_ttl_hours` (default: 4h).
- **OpenPipeline metric-extraction processors**: six processors deriving login attempt counters (`failed`, `successful`, `total`) and task run state counters (`failed`, `cancelled`, `successful`) from DSOA log telemetry. Deploy with `deploy_dt_assets.sh --scope=openpipeline`. See `docs/openpipeline/README.md`.
- **Per-database event table support** for `event_log` plugin (`discover_db_event_tables: false` opt-in): discovers DB-level `EVENT_TABLE` parameter overrides to prevent silent telemetry blackout on multi-tenant accounts.
- **Acquisition problem detection**: SQL errors during Snowflake data acquisition are now caught gracefully. A `dsoa.acquisition.problem` bizevent is emitted with the source view and error detail instead of crashing the agent run. Disable via `plugins.self_monitoring.detect_acquisition_problems: false`.
- **Ingest-quality warning detection**: DSOA inspects Dynatrace API and OTLP exporter responses for partial rejections and attribute trimming, emitting `dsoa.ingest.warning` bizevents. Disable via `plugins.self_monitoring.detect_ingest_warnings: false`.
- **Resource Monitor credit alerting**: Davis events at configurable threshold bands (default: 50/80/90/100%). Events auto-resolve when usage recovers. Per-monitor threshold overrides via `credits_quota_thresholds`.
- **Docker deployment option**: `ghcr.io/dynatrace-oss/dsoa-deploy` image bundles all deployment tools. Published to GHCR on every release. Single `docker run` command replaces local toolchain installation. See [docs/deployment/docker.md](deployment/docker.md).
- **GitHub Actions workflow template**: `dsoa-deploy-template.yml` ships with each release. Use `--ci-export=github` in the interactive wizard to generate a customized workflow and `GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md`. See [docs/deployment/github-actions.md](deployment/github-actions.md).
- **Interactive deployment wizard** (`--interactive` flag): guides through configuration when `conf/` is missing; auto-triggered if the config file is absent. Use `--defaults` for non-interactive CI config generation from environment variables.
- **New dashboards**: *Org-Level Costs Observability* (org-level credits, storage, data transfer, billing, contract capacity KPIs, and BU/department view); *Performance Explorer* (query operator stats and compilation vs. execution time breakdown); *Warehouse Change Detection* (DDL audit dashboard). *Costs Monitoring* extended with a Warehouse Efficiency section (idle time, auto-suspend audit, estimated credit waste).
- **Org Contract Balance Warning workflow**: monitors remaining Snowflake contract balances every 6 hours and alerts when any balance drops below a configurable threshold.

### Changed

- **`service_user` deploy option removed**: replaced by automatic `--temporary-connection` detection when `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT` and `SNOWFLAKE_USER` environment variables are both set. `setup.sh` skips named connection profile creation in the same scenario.
- `docs/INSTALL.md` restructured: Docker is the primary quick-start path; detailed guides moved to `docs/deployment/`.
- Updated `snowflake-snowpark-python` minimum version to `>=1.49.0`.
- Memory handling and processing performance improved for high-volume accounts: per-row overhead reduced by eliminating unnecessary `pd.Series` allocations; events and metrics exporters flush mid-batch to bound peak memory. New `dsoa.agent.memory.peak_rss` metric emitted after each plugin run.

### Deprecated

- `event_usage` plugin is deprecated and disabled by default. Use `metering` instead. Will be removed in 0.9.6. To reproduce the same data, filter by `snowflake.service.type == "TELEMETRY_DATA_INGEST"`.

### Fixed

- **`snowflake.table.full_name` now emitted by `query_history`, `shares`, and `snowpipes` plugins**: the 0.9.4 refactoring introduced this FQN dimension for `data_volume` and `dynamic_tables` but missed three other plugins. All table-level telemetry now carries a fully-qualified `DB.SCHEMA.TABLE` name alongside `db.collection.name`. The `snowpipes` function resolves FQN from the pipe's own DB/schema when the pipe DDL only stores a partially-qualified table name. (BIZOBS-193)
- **`db.collection.name` now follows OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions v1.28+** across all plugins: this field contains only the bare table name (no database or schema prefix). Previously, `query_history` incorrectly emitted the fully-qualified name (`DB.SCHEMA.TABLE`) in this field; starting 0.9.5 it emits only the table name. All other plugins were already compliant. Use `snowflake.table.full_name` when a fully-qualified reference is needed. (BIZOBS-193)
- **Admin deployment ordering** (`scope=admin`): admin overrides no longer silently clobbered by plugin files. `10_admin.sql` moved to `80_admin.sql` so it sorts after all plugin files. (BIZOBS-115)
- `serverless_tasks` context: `db.namespace` and `snowflake.schema.name` no longer emit empty strings for DSOA internal scheduler tasks. New `snowflake.task.is_internal` boolean dimension identifies internal tasks. (BDX-1904)
- `event_log` plugin setup now adapts to Snowflake BCR Bundle 2026\_02 (`LOG_EVENT_LEVEL` parameter): sets `LOG_EVENT_LEVEL = INFO` at database level when the BCR is active, skips gracefully on pre-BCR accounts.
- `snowflake.task.run.attempt` now emits as a numeric integer instead of a string. Downstream DQL queries no longer need `toLong()` casts. Redeploy with `--scope=plugins,config` to apply. (BDX-1903)
- Config redeploy now fully replaces the config table (DELETE + INSERT) so removed entries take effect immediately. Previously, stale entries could override `disabled_by_default: true`.
- Disabled plugins have their Snowflake tasks suspended automatically on every redeploy, regardless of deploy scope.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- Pipes monitoring plugin.
- Six new dashboards: Budgets & FinOps, Data Volume & Storage, Query Deep Dive, Shares & Governance, Snowpipes Monitoring, and Tasks & Pipelines.
- Five Davis AI-powered anomaly detection workflows: credits exhaustion, data volume anomaly, dynamic table drift, query slowdown, and table performance degradation.
- Dashboard and workflow deployment automation via `scripts/deploy/deploy_dt_assets.sh` with `dtctl` integration.
- Per-plugin configurable lookback time for historical data catchup.
- Support for `SNOWFLAKE.TELEMETRY.EVENTS` as account-level event table.
- AI-assisted development infrastructure: GitHub Copilot instructions with architecture context and safety guardrails; OpenCode agent configuration with seven domain-specific skills (`plugin-development`, `dynatrace-dashboard`, `dynatrace-workflow`, `qa-runner`, `snowflake-synthetic`, `pr-reviewer`, `dashboard-docs`); semantic telemetry definitions as AI context; scaffolded `.github/context/` for private developer planning.

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `db.collection.name` now contains bare table name (e.g., `ORDERS`) instead of FQN. Use new `snowflake.table.full_name` attribute for fully-qualified names.
- **BREAKING**: Task timestamp fields (`snowflake.task.run.scheduled_time`, etc.) now use epoch nanoseconds instead of ISO 8601 strings.
- Event log plugin now reports `WARN`/`ERROR` entries from all `DTAGENT_*_DB` instances by default (set `cross_tenant_monitoring: false` to opt out).
- Shares & Governance dashboard tile 14 renamed to "Shares No Longer Observed" with improved 7-day log-history detection.
- Updated Costs Monitoring, Query Performance, Query Quality, Self-Monitoring, and Snowflake Security dashboards with improved tiles and semantics alignment.
- Migrated all stored procedures to `execute as caller` for improved security (`P_GRANT_IMPORTED_PRIVILEGES` remains `execute as owner` due to privilege requirements).
- Test fixtures migrated from binary `.pkl` to human-readable `.ndjson` format.

### Fixed

- Dynamic table scheduling state fields now emit `NULL` instead of empty strings when absent.
- Dynamic table grant granularity now matches `include` pattern scope (database/schema/table level).
- Span timestamps corrected to prevent re-processing after agent restart.
- Log `observed_timestamp` field now uses nanoseconds per OTLP specification.
- Budget spending view date filtering now uses day granularity to include today's data.
- Deploy script TAG substitution no longer replaces identifiers inside config string values.
- Budget grant procedure handles imported/shared databases and application-owned budgets.

## [0.9.3.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- **DTAGENT_ADMIN Role Privileges**: Fixed critical bug where `DTAGENT_ADMIN` role was missing `DTAGENT_VIEWER` role privileges.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- Admin deployment scope for administrative operations, enabling granular control via `--scope=admin` option.
- Ability to customize names for all Snowflake objects (database, warehouse, resource monitor, roles). Set admin role or resource monitor to `"-"` to skip their creation entirely.
- Upgrade process with `--scope=upgrade --from-version=VERSION` parameters, supporting custom queries for version migrations.
- Bill of Materials files as part of the documentation with structured tables.

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Introduced `DTAGENT_OWNER` role that owns all SnowAgent artifacts. The `DTAGENT_ADMIN` role is now reserved exclusively for elevated administrative privileges, while `DTAGENT_VIEWER` handles regular telemetry-related operations.
- **BREAKING**: Deployment and upgrade now have separate permission requirements with the new owner-admin-viewer role separation model.
- **BREAKING**: Configuration files are now in YAML format. Multi-configuration deployment is no longer supported. Use `convert_config_to_yaml.sh` script to convert existing JSON files.
- **BREAKING**: Reorganized Snowflake-related configuration into nested `core.snowflake` structure.
- Implemented role hierarchy with `ACCOUNTADMIN` → `DTAGENT_OWNER` → `DTAGENT_VIEWER` as primary hierarchy and `DTAGENT_OWNER` → `DTAGENT_ADMIN` as optional admin branch.
- Isolated administrative operations in dedicated admin scripts with automated tests to enforce separation.
- YAML format with lowercase keys to match Snowflake configuration table paths.
- Refactored `deploy.sh` with improved parameter handling using named parameters (`--scope`, `--from-version`, `--output-file`, `--options`).
- Introduced well-defined deployment scopes (`init`, `admin`, `setup`, `plugins`, `config`, `agents`, `apikey`, `all`, `teardown`, `upgrade`).
- The `apikey` deployment scope can now be combined with other scopes.
- When admin role or resource monitor is disabled via `"-"`, related SQL code is automatically excluded from deployment scripts.
- Enabled deployment with only selected plugins based on use case requirements.
- Data retention on `DTAGENT_DB` permanent tables now configurable (default: 1 day).
- Extended code quality checks to include `build/*.py` files.

### Fixed

- Timestamps in logs being sent as nanoseconds instead of milliseconds.
- Duplicated resource attribute fields in event log entries.
- Array-type dimensions (e.g., `db.snowflake.dbs`, `db.snowflake.tables`) were being sent as Python list representations causing 400 Bad Request errors. Arrays are now properly converted to comma-separated strings.

## [0.9.2] - 2025-11-24

### Added

- Example dashboards to help users visualize and interpret telemetry data, including costs monitoring, self-monitoring, and Snowflake security dashboards.
- Options to configure minimum query runtime and the maximum number of top queries for deeper analysis.
- Support for `RECORD_ATTRIBUTES` in event log metrics.
- Suite of code quality checks to the automated build process.
- Comprehensive troubleshooting guide for debugging data delivery issues.

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Self-monitoring telemetry now has `dsoa.run.context` set to `self_monitoring` (underscore) instead of `self-monitoring` (hyphen).
- Telemetry types (e.g., events, spans) can now be excluded, either globally or on a per-plugin basis.
- Data Schema plugin now reports on objects modified by DDL queries as events.
- Resource Monitors and Users plugins now use explicit column selection to prevent errors from column order changes.
- Telemetry sender now supports labeling and classification of telemetry calls and `SHOW` statements.
- Event handling now supports sending multiple events in a single call.
- Plugin and context names are now available as metric dimensions.
- Improved performance of reading and processing telemetry data. Added safety limits and ordering to event log queries.
- Agent execution now returns detailed status information, including the number of telemetry objects sent by type, plugin, and run context.
- Deployment process now reports its start and finish as BizEvents.
- API post timeout and retry delay are now configurable for metrics and events.
- Documentation improved for easier navigation as online GitHub pages.

## [0.9.1] - 2025-09-18

### Added

- Modular documentation structure with separate files (`PLUGINS.md`, `SEMANTICS.md`, `APPENDIX.md`).

### Changed

- `SEND_TELEMETRY` procedure now supports `SHOW` statements, enabling more flexible custom queries.

### Fixed

- Resource Monitors queries now use explicit column selection to prevent errors from column order changes in `SHOW WAREHOUSES`.
- Query History upgrade for procedure `P_REFRESH_RECENT_QUERIES` to work correctly when upgrading from versions prior to 0.8.3.

## [0.9.0] - 2025-07-25

### Added

- **Open Source Release**: The project is now available as an Open Source project on GitHub under the permissive MIT license.

## [0.8.3] - 2025-07-14

### Changed

- **Meta-field semantics**: In order to align with rebranding to new official name of Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent (DSOA) or
  Dynatrace SnowAgent in short, a number of field names had to be refactored.

### Plugins Updated

- **Shares**: Reduced the number of events sent by the plugin to improve performance.
- **Query History**: Empty queries executed by SYSTEM user at `COMPUTE_SERVICE_WH_*` are no longer reported to Dynatrace.

### Added

- **Tutorial**: Step-by-step debug tutorial to check if telemetry on currently running queries is correctly delivered via active_queries
  plugin to Dynatrace.
- **Test Suite**: Test suite now ensures that standardized views deliver `TIMESTAMP` column.

### Improved

- **Improved Security Model**: Basic plugin tasks are now executed as `DTAGENT_VIEWER`, with only special tasks executed as `DTAGENT_ADMIN`.
- **Enhanced Communication Handling**: Improved auto-detection of communication issues between Snowflake and Dynatrace, reducing time to
  wrap up processes that were unsuccessful in sending telemetry to Dynatrace.
- **Optimized Deployment**: Monitoring grants are no longer granted during deployment time, reducing time to deploy the complete agent.
- **Cost Optimization**: Tasks are now scheduled `USING CRON` to reduce costs of running the agent by saturating usage of warehouse time.
- **Enhanced Deployment Script**: Improved interaction in `deploy.sh` when `DTAGENT_TOKEN` is not provided.

### Fixed

- **BizEvents Timestamps**: Fixed timestamps of BizEvents sent from Snowflake.
- **SSL Connection Handling**: SSL connection issues are now gracefully handled during the deployment process.
- **Negative Elapsed Time**: Negative values of `snowflake.time.total_elapsed` are no longer propagated from Snowflake telemetry.

- **Status Logging**: Fixed how results of running Agent are reported in `STATUS.LOG_PROCESSED_MEASUREMENTS` in case of no data being
  processed.
- **Span Hierarchy**: Fixed span hierarchy reported from Snowflake query parent ID.

## [0.8.2] - 2025-05-20

### Changed

- **Multi-Config Deployment**: Configuration is now expected to be a JSON array of objects. Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent is
  deployed to all specified configurations, with keys from the first configuration taking precedence in case of conflicts.
- **Users Plugin**: Now sends all user-related information as logs.
- **Timestamp-Triggered Events**: The name of the timestamp field that triggered the event is now sent as the value of the
  `snowflake.event.trigger` field in the event.

### Plugins Updated

- **Active Queries**:
  - Introduced a configurable fast mode via the `PLUGINS.ACTIVE_QUERIES.FAST_MODE` key. The existing filter from
    `PLUGINS.ACTIVE_QUERIES.REPORT_EXECUTION_STATUS` remains available and is applied in addition to the mode.
  - Updated `MONITOR` privileges granted to Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent roles to ensure visibility into all queries.
- **Users**: Added multiple monitoring modes: `DIRECT_ROLES`, `ALL_ROLES`, and `ALL_PRIVILEGES`. See the "Users Plugin" section for more
  details.
- **Query History**: Improved performance by accelerating the process of granting Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent the necessary
  permissions to monitor all warehouses.

### Added

- **Communication Failure Handling**: Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent now aborts execution upon persistent communication issues. A
  task status BizEvent is sent with `dsoa.task.exec.status` set to `FAILED`, including details of the last failed connection attempt.

### Fixed

- **Teardown Process**: Correctly tears down tagged instances.
- **Span Event Reporting**: Removed the hard limit of 128 span events. The limit is now configurable via `OTEL.SPANS.MAX_EVENT_COUNT`.
- **Spans for Queries**: Fixed the problem with a hierarchy of query calls not being represented by a hierarchy of spans (*0.8.2 Hotfix 1*).
- **Self-Monitoring Configuration**: Plugin default configurations no longer overwrite self-monitoring settings.
- **Self-Monitoring BizEvents**: BizEvents are now sent by default when Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent is deployed and executed.

## [0.8.1] - 2025-03-24

### Changed

- **Active Queries**: The plugin no longer reports a summary of query statuses since the last run. By default, only queries with
  `snowflake.query.execution_status` set to `RUNNING` are reported.
- **Event Log**: Entries are now reported as OTEL logs instead of events.
- **Attribute Name Changes**: Corrected typos in attribute names: `authentication.factor.first`, `authentication.factor.second`,
  `snowflake.task.run.scheduled_from`.

### New Plugins

- **Data Schema**: Enables monitoring of data schema changes. Reports on objects (tables, schemas, databases) modified by DDL queries.

### Plugins Updated

- **Active Queries**: Improved performance by reporting only RUNNING queries.
- **Resource Monitors**: Added `snowflake.warehouse.is_unmonitored` attribute. Log entries marked as `WARNING` for warehouses missing
  resource monitors and `ERROR` for accounts missing global resource monitors.
- **Event Log**: Metric entries are now reported as Dynatrace metrics, and traces/spans as OTEL traces/spans, reusing `trace_id` and
  `span_id` generated by Snowflake.
- **Event Log**: Old entries are cleaned up based on their timestamp compared to the `PLUGINS.EVENT_LOG.RETENTION_HOURS` configuration
  option.
- **Trust Center**: Sends all information as logs and metrics, and only critical findings as problem events.

### Added

- **Documentation**: Includes complete chapters on Data Platform Observability and Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent architecture.
- **Bill of Materials**: Lists Snowflake objects delivered and referenced by Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent.
- **New Attribute**: `deployment.environment.tag` helps identify Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent instances by `CORE.TAG` value.

### Improved

- **Code Quality**: Multiple improvements, including automated code quality checks and using YAML format for semantic dictionary
  `instruments-def` files.
- **Telemetry**: `dsoa.task.exec.id` is now shared among all telemetry sent in a given run of the plugin, even if different types of objects
  are being sent.
- **Documentation**: Improved clarity on how each plugin sends telemetry data, specifying what is sent as logs, spans, events, bizevents, or
  metrics.

### Fixed

- **Active Queries**: Long-running queries are reported each time the plugin executes. If a query remains `RUNNING` for an hour, it will be
  reported 5 times with the default 10-minute interval.
- **Query History**: Now reports queries executed by external tasks or those without `snowflake.query.parent_id` in the `QUERY_HISTORY`
  view.
- **Trust Center**: Correctly reports `status.message` after changes to the content of `SCANNER_NAME` in `TRUST_CENTER.FINDINGS`.
- **Event Log**: Correctly runs in multitenancy mode.
- Code Adjustments: Correctly sends complex objects after migrating to the new version of OTEL libraries.
- Teardown Process: Removes resource monitors associated with the Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent instance being removed.

## [0.8.0] - 2025-01-09

### Changed
