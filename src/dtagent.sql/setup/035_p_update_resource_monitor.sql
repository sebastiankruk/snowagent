-- We need resource monitor setup for Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent to ensure we don't spend too much credits
-- This procedure allows updating the credit quota dynamically based on configuration values
-- It is called by CONFIG.UPDATE_FROM_CONFIGURATIONS() to apply credit_quota changes from the config
--
-- Note: DTAGENT_OWNER has OWNERSHIP and MODIFY privileges on DTAGENT_RS resource monitor,
-- which allows this procedure to execute as caller without requiring ACCOUNTADMIN privileges
