"""Tests validating that export_semantics.py faithfully converts instruments-def to SD YAML.

These tests verify the fidelity of the export pipeline: every field, enum, brief,
and example in ``instruments-def.yml`` must appear correctly in the generated output.
Tests run the actual ``SemanticExporter`` against real instruments-def files.

Note:
    All tests use ``@pytest.mark.integration`` because they invoke the full
    export pipeline and read real source files.
